# Milestone 2 Project - Data Dashboard
This site is for those interested in data about wine. This dataset was obtained from TODO. It contains information about different wines, their origination, province, year. It also has interesting data such as reviews. Reviews contain user names and twitter handles. It is a responsive dashboard, so users can get accurate up to date information in the click of a button.

## UX
As this is a dashboard, i chose to use the template of a 'single page application'. This is because the point of the dashboard is so that a user can take one look at the screen and absorb the data that is there. I put 6 graphs on the screen, as this is a good number for a human to absorb information with.

Although this is a single page application, these types of applications are sometimes thought of to be boring. I wanted to add a twist to the regular dashboard. I added some styling that is not normally seen on these types of applicaitons.

When the user visits the page they are greeted with the site logo in a very aesthetically pleasing way. It encourages them to scroll, as it has an element of curiosity. This is because the site name is 'Wine not?', which is a question, so indulging the users curiosity. The screen is completely black, so the first instinct would be to scroll.

The user is then greeted with an introduction to what the site is, so they can understand. Here is a very basic overview of the data available.

The first graph is a simple graph of different wines by the country. This is easily absorbed by the user and easily understood. The following graphs are slightly more complex.

The final spread of data, is a list of the reviews, with the reviewer names and twitter handles.

The user is then shown the TODO site footer, where they can contact the site owners.

## Testing
Browsers this site has been tested in: Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. 
Devices this site has been tested on: Android, iOS.
In order to check that the site behaves as expected on different screen sizes, i used the Chrome Developer Tools changing the size of screen. I also tested on the different devices available in the developer Tools to ensure that they all look as i intended them to.
**After analyzing making d3 charts responsive, it proved too difficult to complete for this project, but is something that should be done in future.
I used the w3 validation tool on my site once it was deployed to check for any errors in my code.
I also used the error window in chrome developer tools ensuring that i there are no issues.

## Deployment
This site was deployed on github pages. In order to do this, I had to go to the Settings tab, and click deploy.

## Credits
I got the styling and idea for the logo in the header from: https://codepen.io/FrankieDoodie/pen/dgVGad
